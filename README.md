# pdf-tools

The main goal of pdf-tools is to create a pdf filing microservice. Pdf-tools requires three inputs:a pdf file to fill, the data to fill it, and a data-to-pdf mapping file. The data must be in json format as must the data-to-pdf mapping file. The data-to-pdf mapping file allows any one to easily use the software to fill a new pdf without having to touch any of the application's code
